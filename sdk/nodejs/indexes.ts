/**
 * ## # Resource: splunk.Indexes
 *
 * Create and manage data indexes.
 *
 * ## Authorization and authentication
 *
 * By default, all users can list all indexes. However, if the indexesListAll capability is enabled in authorize.conf, access to all indexes is limited to only those roles with this capability.
 * To enable indexesListAll capability restrictions on the data/indexes endpoint, create a [capability::indexes_list_all] stanza in authorize.conf. Specify indexes_list_all=enabled for any role permitted to list all indexes from this endpoint.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as splunk from "@pulumi/splunk";
 *
 * const user01_index = new splunk.Indexes("user01-index", {
 *     maxHotBuckets: 6,
 *     maxTotalDataSizeMb: 1000000,
 * });
 * ```
